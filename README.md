# Genetic Algorithm to find optimal engine configuration

A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation. This project deals with designing, implementing and testing a genetic algorithm program to find the optimal engine configurations.

### Genetic Algorithm Code design implementation Genetic algorithm comprises of five stages as follows: 
1. Initialising `population`. 
2. Evaluating the `fitness score` of each chromosome string in the population. 
3. Selecting the optimal N% chromosome strings based on their fitness score (`selection`). 
4. Implementing `Crossover` function on the optimal chromosome strings.
5. Implementing `Mutation` function on the optimal chromosome strings.

This project will review how each of the above five stages are designed and implemented to find optimal engine configurations using genetic algorithm coding in `C#` programming language using a `console application`.

The complete code of the project is in `EL3300_assignment_GA_complete_code/EL3300_assignment_GA` direcory of this repository.
